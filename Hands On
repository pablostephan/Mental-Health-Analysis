**DIAGNOSIS BY AGE GROUP**

**Creation of Age Groups:**

The **CASE WHEN** statement divides ages into specific groups (e.g., 20 years or less, 21 to 30 years, etc.) using logical comparisons with the **AGE** column.

**Counting Diagnoses:**

The **COUNT(*)** function counts the total number of records (diagnoses) in each age group and diagnosis type.

**Grouping Data:**

The **GROUP BY** clause groups the results by age group (**Age_group**) and diagnosis type, allowing for a count of diagnoses for each unique combination of age group and diagnosis.

**Sorting Results:**

The **ORDER BY** clause organizes the results:
- By age group: The age groups are sorted, usually in ascending order.
- By the number of diagnoses: Within each age group, diagnoses are sorted in descending order, showing the most frequent diagnoses first.

**Summary:**

The code extracts data from a medical diagnosis table, creates age groups, counts the number of diagnoses in each group, and sorts the results to facilitate analysis.
