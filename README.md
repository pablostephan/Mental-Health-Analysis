The **Mental Health Diagnosis and Treatment Monitoring** dataset includes 500 synthetic records with patient demographics, symptom severity, medications, therapy types, and treatment progress, created for research and analysis purposes. This data was retrieved from *Kaggle*, from the dataset titled *Mental Health Diagnosis and Treatment Monitoring.*


> DIAGNOSIS BY AGE GROUP

**Creation of Age Groups:**

The **CASE WHEN** statement divides ages into specific groups (e.g., 20 years or less, 21 to 30 years, etc.) using logical comparisons with the **AGE** column.

**Counting Diagnoses:**

The **COUNT(*)** function counts the total number of records (diagnoses) in each age group and diagnosis type.

**Grouping Data:**

The **GROUP BY** clause groups the results by age group (**Age_group**) and diagnosis type, allowing for a count of diagnoses for each unique combination of age group and diagnosis.

**Sorting Results:**

The **ORDER BY** clause organizes the results:
- By age group: The age groups are sorted, usually in ascending order.
- By the number of diagnoses: Within each age group, diagnoses are sorted in descending order, showing the most frequent diagnoses first.

**Summary:**

The code extracts data from a medical diagnosis table, creates age groups, counts the number of diagnoses in each group, and sorts the results to facilitate analysis.

```
-- Analyzing diagnoses by age groups
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN AGE <= 20 THEN 'Under 20'
    WHEN AGE <= 30 THEN '21 - 30'
    WHEN AGE <= 40 THEN '31 - 40'
    WHEN AGE <= 50 THEN '41 - 50'
    WHEN AGE <= 60 THEN '51 - 60'
    ELSE 'Above 60'
  END AS Age_group,
  Diagnosis,
  COUNT(*) AS Qty_diagnosis_age
FROM mental_health_diagnosis_treatment
GROUP BY Age_group, Diagnosis
ORDER BY Age_group, Qty_diagnosis_age DESC;
```

**ANALYZING QUERY RESULTS**

The table shows the count of diagnoses by age group, with each row representing a specific age group and diagnosis type. The **Qty_diagnosis_age** column indicates the number of people in each age group with a particular diagnosis.

**Key Insights:**

- **Diagnosis distribution**: Identifies which age groups have the highest frequency of certain diagnoses (e.g., "Generalized Anxiety" is more common in ages 51–60, "Panic Disorder" in 21–30).
- **Trends and comparisons**: Highlights trends and allows comparisons of different diagnoses within each age group.
- **Potential applications**: Helps identify at-risk groups, inform health strategies, and serve as a basis for further research.

**Summary:**

This analysis provides valuable insights into age-specific health needs, aiding in informed decisions for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.


> MOST COMMON GENDER, DIAGNOSIS, AND MEDICATION COMBINATIONS

The provided SQL query aims to identify the most frequent combinations of gender, diagnosis, and medication in a mental health dataset. In other words, it seeks to answer the question: "What treatments are most common for each gender and diagnosis?"

```
SELECT
    Gender, 
    Diagnosis, 
    Medication, 
    COUNT(*) AS Medication_Count
FROM
    mental_health_diagnosis_treatment
GROUP BY
    Gender, Diagnosis, Medication
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY
    Medication_Count DESC;
```

Here is an example of the first 10 occurrences.

  **WHAT THE TABLE SHOWS**

- **Common Combinations**: Some treatments are more frequent, like SSRIs for men with panic disorder.
- **Trends**: For example, benzodiazepines are commonly used for anxiety and bipolar disorder in women.
- **Gender Differences**: Men with bipolar disorder receive more mood stabilizers, while women get more benzodiazepines.

**Insights and Applications**

- **Treatment Patterns**: Identifies common treatment trends for different diagnoses and genders.
- **Medication Effectiveness**: Shows which medications are most prescribed, hinting at their effectiveness.

> GENERATING NEW TABLE

To better visualize the results, I used **JOIN** to combine the two previous tables into a new one. This SQL query aims to link prescribed medications for mental health patients with their age groups and diagnoses. It answers questions like:

- What medications are most common in each age group for a specific diagnosis?
- Are there significant treatment differences between young and elderly patients?
- Which diagnoses are more frequent in certain age groups?

```
-- This SQL query groups mental health data by:
-- diagnosis, medication, and age, counting and filtering for frequent gender, diagnosis, and medication combinations.

SELECT
    t1.Gender,
    t1.Diagnosis,
    t1.Medication,
    t1.Medication_Count,
    t2.Qty_diagnosis_age
FROM
(
    SELECT
        Gender,
        Diagnosis,
        Medication,
        COUNT(*) AS Medication_Count
    FROM
        mental_health_diagnosis_treatment
    GROUP BY
        Gender, Diagnosis, Medication
    HAVING
        COUNT(*) > 1
) t1
JOIN
(
    SELECT
        CASE
            WHEN AGE <= 20 THEN 'Under 20'
            WHEN AGE <= 30 THEN '21 - 30'
            WHEN AGE <= 40 THEN '31 - 40'
            WHEN AGE <= 50 THEN '41 - 50'
            WHEN AGE <= 60 THEN '51 - 60'
            ELSE 'Above 60'
        END AS Age_group,
        Diagnosis,
        COUNT(*) AS Qty_diagnosis_age
    FROM
        mental_health_diagnosis_treatment
    GROUP BY
        Age_group, Diagnosis
) t2 ON t1.Diagnosis = t2.Diagnosis
ORDER BY
    t2.Age_group DESC, Medication_Count DESC, Diagnosis;
```

**Summary:**

This query analyzes mental health data, linking age, gender, diagnosis, and treatment. The results can help:

- Identify treatment patterns: What medications are most common for each diagnosis across age groups?
- Compare treatments: Are there differences between men and women or different age groups?
- Analyze diagnosis prevalence: Which diagnoses are more common in certain age ranges?

**Applications:**

- Clinical research: Identify treatment trends and patterns.
- Resource planning: Allocate resources efficiently based on demographic needs.
- Health policy development: Inform the creation of more effective health policies.
