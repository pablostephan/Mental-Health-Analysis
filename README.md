# Mental Health Diagnosis and Treatment Monitoring Dataset

This project analyzes a dataset with 500 synthetic patient records to explore mental health diagnoses, treatments, and their relationship with demographic factors such as age and gender. The dataset contains information on patient demographics, symptoms, medications, therapies, and treatment progress.

## Objective

The goal of the project is to uncover patterns and trends in mental health diagnoses and treatments. By examining how diagnoses and treatments vary across different age groups and genders, we aim to provide insights into common treatment combinations and the effectiveness of medications.

## Key Analysis

1. **Diagnosis by Age Group:**  
   The dataset is segmented into age groups to analyze the distribution of diagnoses across different life stages. This will help identify which diagnoses are more prevalent in certain age ranges.

2. **Gender, Diagnosis, and Medication Combinations:**  
   The project investigates the most common combinations of gender, diagnosis, and medication. This analysis helps determine which treatments are more frequent for specific genders and diagnoses, shedding light on potential treatment patterns and trends.

3. **Comprehensive Data Analysis:**  
   A combined analysis of age, gender, diagnosis, and medication will be performed to explore deeper correlations. This step aims to identify whether certain medications are more commonly prescribed to specific age groups or genders for particular diagnoses.

## Insights and Applications

- **Diagnosis Trends:** Identify which diagnoses are most prevalent in different age groups, helping to focus attention on high-risk populations.
- **Treatment Patterns:** Discover common medication prescriptions and their effectiveness across different genders and diagnoses, which can inform treatment guidelines.
- **Health Policy and Resource Planning:** The findings can support healthcare professionals in resource allocation and the creation of more targeted mental health interventions.

## Conclusion

By analyzing the relationship between demographics, diagnoses, and treatments, this project provides valuable insights that can guide clinical research, treatment planning, and health policy development, improving mental health care delivery.
