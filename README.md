The **Mental Health Diagnosis and Treatment Monitoring** dataset includes 500 synthetic records with patient demographics, symptom severity, medications, therapy types, and treatment progress, created for research and analysis purposes.

This data was retrieved from *Kaggle*, from the dataset titled *Mental Health Diagnosis and Treatment Monitoring.*

This dataset enables a detailed analysis of mental health data, linking information such as age, gender, diagnosis, and treatment. The results can be used to:

- **Identify treatment patterns**: What medications are most common for each diagnosis across different age groups?
- **Compare treatments between groups**: Are there differences in treatments between men and women or across different age ranges?
- **Analyze diagnosis prevalence**: Which diagnoses are most common in certain age groups?

**Applications**:

- **Clinical Research**: Identify trends and treatment patterns for different patient groups.
- **Resource Planning**: Allocate resources more efficiently based on the needs of each demographic group.
- **Health Policy Development**: Inform the creation of more effective health policies.
